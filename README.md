# Dynamic Form Application

This interactive form application was created **entirely by AI** using Cursor IDE powered by Claude 3.7 Sonnet. No human-written code was involved, including this README.

> **Note**: This is a demonstration project only and should not be used in production environments.

**Live Demo**: [https://chtz.github.io/cursordemo_dynamicform/](https://chtz.github.io/cursordemo_dynamicform/)

## Features

- **Form Functionality**
  - Multi-language support (English/Spanish)
  - Various input types (radio selection, multiline text, display elements)
  - Form validation
  - Debug mode for form editing and JSON manipulation
  
- **Responsive Design**
  - Mobile-optimized layout and touch targets (44px minimum)
  - iOS home screen capability
  - Consistent light theme regardless of system preferences

## Generating App Icons

To generate PNG icons from the SVG template:

1. Install dependency: `npm install sharp`
2. Run script: `node public/generate-icons.js`

This creates all necessary icon sizes for web and mobile platforms.

## Development

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## AI Development Process

This project demonstrates how AI can create a full-featured web application with:
- Form handling and validation
- State management
- Mobile/responsive optimizations
- Accessibility considerations
- Cross-platform compatibility

The entire development process was guided through conversation with Claude 3.7 Sonnet in Cursor.
